# Amber Depths — to do

Only what's still open. Finished work goes to [DONE.md](DONE.md) with the date and commit. Ideas Sam mentions go
under *Ideas (later)*; ask before building one.

## Where things stand (keep this current, a few lines)

**Live on `main`:** v31 (merged 5 Nov 2026, commit `51b1a6d`): everything so far, plus the version tag and Controls.
Built from `src/` with `node src/build.mjs`.
**On `staging`, not live yet:** nothing.
**Next up:** Sam is on floor 24+ of Hard Endless (Rogue), says it's no longer a blitz; he reports his final depth
and whether the menu fix and the new Controls work on his iPhone. Then the curve tuning, then boss floors step 2.

## To do

- **Tune the Endless curve from Sam's play.** Knobs at the top of the monster code in the source: `DEEP_FROM` (12),
  `DEEP_DMG` (1.04 per floor, compounding), `DEEP_POTS` (0.95). If potions still pile up, cap how many you can carry.
  Soak test: `test/soak.js` (ignored file; see DONE.md 5 Nov 2026 for how it was run).
- Sam's iPhone bug list from real play (touch, Safari, feel) goes in BUGS.md as it comes.

## Ideas (later)

- More classes, a second wave of relics, cosmetic titles on the daily share text.
- **Echo** (reveal everything within 8 tiles for a few turns) as an upgrade or scroll; spare from the Mole design.
- Leaderboards (would need a backend).
- **Endless boss floors, step 2 (Sam's plan, 5 Nov 2026; not built yet):** Golems stay on every 5th floor (they already
  are). Every 10th floor becomes a half-size dungeon with a boss arena and one of 3 bigger bosses with their own attacks
  (Sam: a Cyclops, a mini dragon, one more). Bigger boss = better reward: pick 2 upgrades, or pick from 4, plus better
  loot. Builds on new floors, so a run in progress gets it from its next 10th floor after a reload.
  Other ideas: a "new depth record" moment, deep-only monsters or elite abilities past floor 15-20.
- **Map/ASCII-art font options (Sam, 5 Nov 2026; probably not worth it):** the map needs a monospace font with
  box-drawing glyphs, or the grid breaks; only a few fit (e.g. IBM Plex Mono, Fira Mono). Small win, some risk.
- **More upgrades for the pool** as they come up (e.g. thorns, faster ability recharge, potion strength).
- **Trade-off gear bonuses** like a "Reckless" weapon (+50% damage dealt, +25% taken), left over from the deep-loot
  idea (the +N gear itself is done).
- **Cross-device sync without moving (option):** a Worker on a free workers.dev address can store saves for the game
  where it is now, with a short sync code, so no domain move and no lost progress. Mostly Sam playing for now.
- **Cloudflare move (Sam, 5 Nov 2026):** own domain (~$11/yr) on Cloudflare, Worker + D1/KV for leaderboards and
  cross-device saves (a sync code instead of accounts), Ko-fi link (like Popsicle CAD's). Moving domains wipes localStorage, so players
  must Backup on the old address and restore on the new one. Ask Sam before creating anything in Cloudflare.
  Anti-cheat plan: server checks the score formula and plausibility (turns per floor, kills, gold, level); a run token
  from the server at start with a time check; later, full replay checks (seeded randomness + game logic split out to
  run in the Worker, same refactor as the bot project). Anti-abuse: Cloudflare rate limits + Turnstile on submits,
  generated or filtered names, prepared statements, size caps, long random sync codes stored hashed, admin key as a
  Worker secret (never in this public repo).
- **More text styles as unlocks (optional):** extra novelty fonts earned from challenges, like the screen colours.
- **Key rebinding screen:** choose your own keys (numpad is built in for now).
- **Sprite pack option:** swap ASCII cells for tiles (e.g. Kenney's free 1-bit pack tinted amber). ~25-40% of a window.
  Sam may draw his own: 16×16 tiles (bosses 32×32), white/greyscale on transparent so the game can tint them for each
  screen colour, one PNG sheet on a grid. Needs square map cells; on phones the 40×21 map would be ~9 px a tile, so
  add a camera that follows the player there (~20×11 tiles visible).
  Unlock plan (Sam, 5 Nov 2026): ASCII stays the default; a greyscale pixel pack tinted by the screen colour you've
  unlocked (so the existing colour challenges carry over); full-colour pixel art as its own medium-hard challenge.
  Draw once in full colour: the game can make the greyscale version itself.
- **Learning project (Sam):** write a smarter bot: rule-based first, then look-ahead search, then reinforcement learning
  (needs the game logic split out to run headless in Node).
